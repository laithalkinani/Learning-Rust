fn main () {
    println!("Hello, World!"); //semi-colon terminated lines
}

/*
Explanation:
main is the entry point for any Rust program (like C)
fn declares a function
rust is an ahead of time compiled language, meaning you can run it and give the exe to someone else, and
they don't even need to have rust installed 
to run this on windows, type in the command terminal: 
./hello_world

Next we'll learn about cargo dependencies
